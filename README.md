Better. Faster. Stronger. Outrun the demons.

Most workout apps focus on weight loss as a measure of success. We thought there must be a way to measure our capabilities instead. So we asked ourselves- What would buffy do? and Slayer in Training was born.

Every exercise you’ll see in our workout generator can be done without any special equipment. You can choose to focus on mobility, strength, endurance, or “The Full Buffy” (all three) whether you have 15 minutes or an hour, Slayer in Training will create a unique, dynamic workout just for you.  

Features: 
1) Login with Facebook to save your workouts and track your progress.
2) Built in timer to time runs or AMRPs (as many reps as possible).
3) Generate a unique workout each time you hit “Ready. Set. Slay”.


Future add ons: 
1) Save your favorite workouts and recall them later.
2) Create your own workout from our database and save them.

4) Link to others on the app and have AMRP or run times contests with leader boards 
5) Pop-up banners of encouragement 
6) Build out resources page with user API search for videos
