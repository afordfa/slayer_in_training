Better. Faster. Strong. Outrun the demons.

Most workout apps focus on weight loss as a measure of success. We thought there must be a way to measure our capabilities instead. So we asked ourselves- What would buffy do?  and Slayer in Training was born.

Every exercise you’ll see in our workout generator can be done without any special equipment. You can choose to focus on mobility, strength, endurance or “The Full Buffy” (all three) whether you have 15 minutes or an hour, Slayer in Training will create a unique, dynamic workout just for you.  

Features: 
1) login to save your workouts and track your progress
2) Built in timer to time runs or AMRPs (as many reps as possible)
3) a unique workout is generated each time you “Ready. Set. Slay”
